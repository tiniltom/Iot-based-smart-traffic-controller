IoT Based Smart Traffic Controller
Goal: have the traffic light system function based on the sensed data. Currently, these systems follow some pre-defined cycle of actions.

Initial thoughts: platform and boards comparaison resulted in the conclusion to use the Arduino Uno board. It contains all the features needed to develop this project.

Future Work: Traffic Lights communicate with the neighboring systems for better prediction. Traffic light system also can communicate with cars to exchange traffic conditions and trajectories.
